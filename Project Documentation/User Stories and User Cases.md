1.Potencial Users:

Our digital humanities repository targets diverse audiences that have varying needs related to Japanese and Chinese historical and cultural data. The potential users of our protocol include:

Academic researchers: who need extensive historical data for in-depth studies and publications.

University faculty: who seek reliable sources for course content and research guidance.

Students: from undergraduate to graduate level who require historical data for their academic projects.

Independent scholars: who might not have institutional support but are passionate about Japanese and Chinese studies.
Cultural organization: such as museums and libraries, looking to enrich their displays and educational programs with authentic, well-documented historical data.


2.Existing Dataset:

For the purposes of this user case, we've chosen the Japan Center for Asian Historical Records (JACAR), which is an invaluable resource for anyone studying Japanese actions and policies in the Asia-Pacific region. It contains primary source materials that are meticulously digitized and cataloged, offering insights not only into military and diplomatic actions but also into cultural and economic exchanges. This makes JACAR particularly valuable for interdisciplinary studies that require primary historical documents.

3.1 User Story Person A

As a faculty member specializing in Sino-Japanese war studies, I require an integrated dataset that encompasses a diverse array of archival documents, military records, and scholarly articles from both Japanese and Chinese sources. This repository should not only provide access to these materials but also facilitate their detailed comparative analysis through advanced search tools and cross-referencing capabilities. My aim is to enrich both my research and teaching materials with nuanced historical insights drawn from well-supported comparative studies.

3.2 User Story 1 Use Case:

User Group: Faculty Member Specializing in Sino-Japanese War Studies

Objective: To leverage a comprehensive digital humanities repository that integrates both Japanese and Chinese historical records for academic research and teaching.

Actions and Goals:

Comparative Analysis: I need a platform that offers advanced search capabilities, including keyword searches that recognize both Japanese Kanji and Chinese Hanzi characters. This system should support searches by event, date, and type of document (e.g., military, diplomatic) across both Japanese and Chinese archives.

Research and Education: The platform should allow me to extract and download data in various formats, annotate them, and integrate these findings into academic papers, lectures, and course materials. I would also benefit from tools that enable visualization of data timelines and geographic mapping of events.

3.3 User Story 1 Assessment:

While JACAR provides a valuable foundation with its detailed repository of Japanese governmental and military documents, these are primarily centered on Japan's perspectives and roles during the Sino-Japanese wars. To achieve a balanced and comprehensive view, it's imperative that equivalent access to Chinese archival data is provided. This should include a similar depth in documentation, encompassing military records, diplomatic communications, and cultural narratives. The ideal platform would feature a unified interface that not only facilitates straightforward access but also supports advanced queries across both Japanese and Chinese datasets. For example, the system should allow users to perform cross-database searches using specific events, dates, or document types as filters. This functionality must be supported by multilingual metadata capabilities, ensuring that entries are accessible and searchable in Japanese, Chinese, and English. This is crucial for fostering an inclusive academic environment that accommodates researchers from different linguistic backgrounds. Also, the current JACAR offerings, while extensive, reveal gaps, particularly in the absence of analytical tools which could greatly enhance the study of historical patterns. Researchers would benefit from tools that visualize data, such as interactive maps showing the geographic locations of key events and timeline tools that display the chronological sequence of battles and diplomatic efforts. Such tools would enable researchers to draw more nuanced conclusions by visualizing the interactions and impacts of various historical events in the Sino-Japanese context.


4.1 User Story Person B

As an undergraduate student currently studying and exploring my interest in East Asian history, I have chosen to compare and contrast the historical significance of military art during wartime for purposes, such as tactics and propaganda, and after wartime for purposes, such as commemoration. I came across this database after my professor had showcased it in class and found the resource to be useful. In particular, I am interested in browsing and compiling specific data as well as citing them for my final project.

4.2 User Story 2 Use Case

User Group: Undergraduate student who is currently exploring their major and gravitating towards history. They speak limited Chinese and have limited reading skills. 

Objective: Finding and compiling relevant paintings and illustrations for their final project in an East Asian History class. 

Actions and Goals:

Comparative Analysis: Utilize JACAR along with additional postwar military art to perform analysis on their commonalities and differences. 

Brainstorming: Browse JACAR webpage to brainstorm topics and events. 

4.3 Assessment

While JACAR provides a comprehensive overview of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 alongside digitized resources from the British Library, it fails to fully utilize the rich metadata available within its datasets. Users are assumed to have existing domain knowledge and are expected to conduct their searches using keywords via an embedded search engine. In both the glossary and gallery sections, JACAR does not allow cross-reference searches, despite including metadata such as relevant categories and artist names. Given the user's objective and academic background, they could benefit from a dataset that prioritizes enhancing discoverability and accessibility.

Furthermore, JACAR's website presents an intriguing decision when it comes to its multilingual dataset. Since it was a collaborative project between the Japan Center of Asian Historical Records and the British Library, title-related metadata fields are presented in their original language, its romanization of either Japanese romaji or Chinese pinyin, and the English translation. However, metadata for Chinese-origin materials is also sometimes notated in Japanese, particularly in cases where the original publisher or artist is unknown or anonymous. While the decision is somewhat understandable considering the collaborative nature of this project, the representation of the origin language, translation and their associated metadata should be carefully evaluated by data curators in order to find a balance between accuracy and uniformity.
