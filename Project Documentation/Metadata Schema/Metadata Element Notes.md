### Controlled Vocabularies

One element `dc:subect` include controlled vocabularies. `dc:subject` can include Digitial Humanities methods and the subject matter the DH research and project covers. 

For DH method controlled vocabulary, we recommend the [Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/). The TaDiRAH provides a comprehensive list of terminology for DH research. It has also been translated into [Japanese](https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH/blob/master/jpn/readme.md).

For subject matter, we temporarily recommend LCSH's subject headings, which, despite the criticism, does cover an extensive range of topics and subjects. For future usage, we intend to develop a controlled vocabulary within the scope of our repository or find subject specifc controlled vocabularies that better represent the topics convered.
