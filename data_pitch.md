### Abbrieviated Data Pitch

I am very invested in Digital Humanities and a call for good metadata documentation for DH research. For this quarter, I am interested in continuing developing my final proposal of a curated catalog of best practices in DH research within the discipline of Japanese studies (though I am more than happy to expand if anyone is interested in collaborating).

At this point I can think of mainly two issues pertaining to topic of interest:  1) Scattered Datasets: Rich and valuable datasets, if not in repositories already, are scattered all over Github. 2) Lack of standardization and documentation: Researchers point to a set of publicly available datasets they used but not a documentation of how they used the datasets. Sometimes, the documentation is summarized by their journal article.
