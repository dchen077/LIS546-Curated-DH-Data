### Controlled Vocabularies

For `dc:coverage`, we recommend the [Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/) (TGN). While the thesaurus' main goal is not provided to accurate geographical information about a place, we found TGN's focus on multilingual, multicultural, historical aspects of geographical location to be exceptionally relevant to the scope of this repository. User can both search with keywords or browse the TGN hierarchies. 

For `dc:type`, we recommend the [Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/tadirah/en/). The TaDiRAH provides a comprehensive list of terminology for DH research, covering three aspects of DH research: activities, objects, and techniques. Activities refer to what is being done, objects refer to the scholarly object(s) a given method or technique is being applied to, and technique refers to specific information about how a method is being applied. It has also been translated into [Japanese](https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH/blob/master/jpn/readme.md).

For `dc:subject` and `dc:temporal`, we tentatively recommend [LCSH's subject headings](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCSH/freelcsh.html), which, despite the criticism, does cover an extensive range of topics and subjects. For future usage, we intend to develop a controlled vocabulary within the scope of our repository or find dommain-specifc controlled vocabularies that better represent the topics convered.
