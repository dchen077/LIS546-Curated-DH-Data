# Data Licensing

Our project commits to the principles of open data, ensuring that the datasets we curate and distribute are freely available for academic research, education, and other non-commercial uses. After reviewing guidelines from [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/), [Cornell Library's IP rights for data management](https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/sharing/intellectual-property/), and [Data.World's guide to open licenses](https://data.world/blog/what-license-should-i-use-for-my-data/), we have decided to adopt the following licensing strategy:

### Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0):

This license allows users to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and derivative works based upon it, but only if they give the author or licensor the credits in the manner specified. This choice is informed by its flexibility and the ease with which it can be integrated into a variety of projects, providing the necessary protection for our data creators while encouraging wide dissemination and use of the data. 
More about CC BY 4.0 can be found on [Creative Commons 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

### Public Domain Dedication (CC0):

For datasets where copyright or database protection is not applicable, or where owners wish to waive all their rights, we will use CC0. CC0 is particularly suitable for datasets compiled from sources that are in the public domain or for basic data that we believe should be freely available without any restrictions.

## Special Considerations

### Cultural Sensitivity and Privacy:

For data that includes culturally sensitive information or personal data that might be subject to privacy regulations, restrictions will be applied. In such cases, data will be reviewed and potentially restricted or provided under specific terms that respect the ethical considerations of research involving human subjects and sensitive cultural content.
These considerations align with the distinctions highlighted by Cornell Library regarding databases versus data and the ethical handling of such content.

### Licensing Compliance and Exceptions:

All datasets will be clearly marked with the applicable license, including appropriate metadata tagging to ensure visibility and clarity of the data usage terms. License details will be included in the dataset's metadata to ensure users are aware of their rights and responsibilities before using the data.
Exceptions to the standard licensing terms may be granted on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the requested use and the specific dataset. Such exceptions will be documented and must be approved by the project's data stewardship team.

This licensing framework is designed to balance the need for open access to digital humanities data with the responsibility to protect the rights of data creators and the sensitivities of the content related to Chinese and Japanese studies. By being explicit about the expectations of how the data can be used and repurposed, we aim to foster an environment of respect and responsibility amongst users of our data.

### Dataset with Existing Licenses

Datasets with existing data licenses, namely CC0 and CCBY4.0, will retain their licenses as they share the same data licenses with this repository. For datasets that include a small amount of data that are under more restrictive licensing, we will be in contact with the depositor and discuss how to best preserve and manage their datasets on a case-by-case basis. We do not accept datasets that include a large amount of data that are under restrictive data license. 

 ## Acknowledgement
 We recognize that humanities data come in a wide variety of formats, from Jupyter notebooks to digitized artworks. Researchers may be able to obtain permission from appropriate GLAM institutions, such as museums and archives, for research purposes. However, they may not be the copyright owner of these data. We encourage researchers to check with the original institution and engage future stakeholders in an open research environment.
